title: "Live Jazz in October"
---

I hope you are enjoying the cozy fall vibes here in Santa Barbara! This month is shaping up to be full of music. We hosted a jazz jam at The Blue Owl last night - we kept it low key for the first event, but it may turn into a recurring event on first Thursdays at 6:00, and we will be promoting it more the next time around. Stay tuned for more on that!

I'd love to see you at one (or more!) of these upcoming shows.

## October Shows

### Soir Noir at Linden Square
**Monday, October 6** | 5:30-7:30pm  
**Linden Square, Carpinteria**

This Monday is our debut at Linden Square - a beautiful new venue in Carpinteria that's similar to the Santa Barbara Public Market. Third Window Brewery serves incredible smash burgers, and Corazon Cocina Sur has fantastic Mexican cuisine. It is a really hip and pleasant vibe out there, a lovely place to enjoy some live music.

### Lunch Break Big Band at SOhO

**SOhO Restaurant & Music Club**

The following Monday, I'll be playing with the Lunch Break Big Band. our set has some real swingin' tunes!


### Soir Noir at Villa Wine Bar
**Thursday, October 23** | 6:00-8:00pm  
**Villa Wine Bar**

This will be our first Soir Noir show at Villa Wine Bar, looking forward to playing out there!

## What We're Working On

We've been doing a deep dive on Brazilian jazz lately, preparing an all-Bossa Nova and Samba program for an [upcoming fundraiser event for Jodi House](https://www.jodihouse.org/special-events). We'll be performing as a quartet, and we'll also be working some of these Jobim classics and other Bossa tunes into our other sets this month.

Hope to see you soon!

Best,

Dillon
