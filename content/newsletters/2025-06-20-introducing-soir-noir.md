We're heading back to one of my favorite venues!

**Soir Noir** (Brandon Kinalele on guitar/vocals and myself on piano)  
**Fox Wine Co.** in the Funk Zone  
**Sunday, January 19** 4:30-6:30pm

To me, the Fox Wine/Topa Topa patio area embodies the classic Funk Zone vibe. It's an awesome spot to grab a drink and enjoy some live music. I'd love to see you there!

## What is Soir Noir?

You may be wondering, what is Soir Noir? After wracking our brains for many weeks, Brandon Kinalele and I came up with a name that we both love for our Jazz project. It is French for "Black Night", and it is a nod to the American cinema tradition of Film Noir which is of course inseparable from jazz.
Here's a taste of our sound from our last show at Fox Wine (and you can get a sense of what a beautiful spot it is, too!):

## What We're Working On

We've been doing a deep dive on Brazilian jazz lately, prepping an all-Bossa Nova and Samba program for an upcoming private event. I absolutely love Bossa - it has such a laid back yet melancholy quality at the same time. We're planning to weave some of these Brazilian influences into our upcoming Fox Wine Co. show, too.

Hope to see you soon!

Best,

Dillon
