title: My Setup
---

## My Editor

- I typically use the font [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) (it's a paid product).
  [IBM Flex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) and
  [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) are two nice free
  alternatives that I like.
- [intellij-elm](https://github.com/klazuka/intellij-elm) - I highly recommend
  trying this tool out to help you refactor your Elm code quickly!
- VS Code for editing JS/TS/markdown

## Site

I built most of my stack for my site so I can build everything in pure Elm and
have the full power of the JAMstack.

- [`elm-pages`](https://elm-pages.com/)
- [`dillonkearns/elm-markdown`](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-markdown)

## Command Line

- My `gh` command that I use to quickly open a directory is using
  [this shell script](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/the-best-code-ive-ever-written-afaf96f49535)
- My terminal is ZSH with oh-my-zsh

## Audio/Video

- I use a
  [Blue Yeti USB microphone](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/). It's
  really easy to set up and sounds great.
